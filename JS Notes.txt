Object.method();

this is how objects and methods are setup
console.log() lets you print or log whatevers in the parathesis to the console
semicolon denotes the end of line of code

math operators for numbers in parathesis 
    Add: +
    Subtract: -
    Multiply: *
    Divide: /
    Remainder: %



Methods
actions we can perform.
We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:
    a period (the dot operator)
    the name of the method
    opening and closing parentheses
E.g. 'example string'.methodName()
more examples
console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim()); //removes white space
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50, math.floor rounds it down to nearesty whole number, * prints random number betwqeen 0 and the value
console.log(Math.ceil(43.8)); // returns smallest integer greater than or equal to 43.8

Properties
every data type has properties for example strings have the length property used like so,
console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5 to the console

Variables
label and store data in memory
They are not values but they contain values
   1. Create a variable with a descriptive name.
   2. Store or update information stored in a variable.
   3. Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.
In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything). 
Use let and const, to create, or declare, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the var keyword to declare variables.
Ex of outdated method=
var myName = 'Arya';
console.log(myName);
= is the assignment operator. It assigns the value ('Arya') to the variable (myName)
var, short for variable, is a JavaScript keyword that creates, or declares, a new variable.
'Arya' is the value assigned (=) to the variable myName. You can also say that the myName variable is initialized with a value of 'Arya'.
After the variable is declared, the string value 'Arya' is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: console.log(myName)
    Variable names cannot start with numbers.
    Variable names are case sensitive, so myName and myname would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
    Variable names cannot be the same as keywords. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out MDN’s keyword documentation.
The let keyword signals that the variable can be reassigned a different value
Ex. 
let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal); // Output: Enchiladas
meal = 'Burrito';
console.log(meal); // Output: Burrito
be aware of when using let (and even var) is that we can declare a variable without assigning the variable a value. In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of undefined:
Ex.
let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350
const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant. If you try to reassign a const variable, you’ll get a TypeError
Constant variables must be assigned a value when declared. If you try to declare a const variable without a value, you’ll get a SyntaxError
Math with variables example
let w = 4;
w = w + 1;
console.log(w); // Output: 5
other examples
let x = 20;
x -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5
console.log(x); // Output: 15
let y = 50;
y *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2
console.log(y); // Output: 100
let z = 8;
z /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2
console.log(z); // Output: 4
ex 2
levelUp += 5
powerLevel -= 100
multiplyMe *= 11
quarterMe /= 4

Variable Operators
The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For example:
let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11
let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19
The + operator can be used to combine two string values even if those values are being stored in variables:
let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'

String interpolation
In the ES6 version of JavaScript, we can insert, or interpolate, variables into strings using template literals. Check out the following example where a template literal is used to log strings together:
Ex:
const myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`);
// Output: I own a pet armadillo.
These help with readability 
Ex2
let myName = "LouiV"
let myCity = "Cle"
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My favorite city is ${myCity}`);
// Prints My name is LouiV. My favorite city is Cle to console

Check data type
The typeof operator checks the value to its right and returns, or passes back, a string of the data type.
Ex:
const unknown1 = 'foo';
console.log(typeof unknown1); // Output: string
const unknown2 = 10;
console.log(typeof unknown2); // Output: number
const unknown3 = true; 
console.log(typeof unknown3); // Output: boolean
