All it takes to use Bootstrap is a few additional lines in our HTML document.
In this lesson, we’ll be working with Bootstrap 4. To incorporate Bootstrap into a project, we have to include two <meta> tags and the Bootstrap CSS library. In the example below, Bootstrap is linked via Content Delivery Network (CDN) in the <head> element, like so:
<head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS for styling and layout-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
There are also some optional JavaScript libraries if we want to add some interactivity to our website and these are inserted at the end of our <body> element. Check out Bootstrap’s Getting Started documentation for more insight. We’ve also added the optional JavaScript links in the code editor
EX2.
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <!-- Add link to Bootstrap CDN below: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
