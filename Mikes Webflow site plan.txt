copy food slider section
copy pie slice animation section
copy testimonial section

cool animations and colors
also bottom input part of website would be good
side menu headers are a nice touch

floating boxes would be good for food items 
have everything be a link to order food
maybe auto generate mnenu... idk
also could use text with image parallax
also timed scroller would be cool
good for building clientele
