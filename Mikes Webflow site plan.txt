good model for a food site
copy floating rocks but replace with food
copy awards section but make it funny and from random people
copy food slider section
copy pie slice animation section
copy testimonial section
maybe even contact page as well

cool animations and colors
also bottom input part of website would be good
side menu headers are a nice touch

floating boxes would be good for food items 
have everything be a link to order food
maybe auto generate mnenu... idk
also could use text with image parallax
also timed scroller would be cool
good for building clientele
