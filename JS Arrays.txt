arrays are javascripts way of making list and are ordered like any list, they can store any data type
    The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
    Each content item inside an array is called an element.
    There are three different elements inside the array.
    Each element inside the array is a different data type.
We can also save an array to a variable.
Ex.
let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

Arrays are 0 indexed so each value is assigned a number starting from zero that increases from left to right
Ex.
cities[0]
In the code snippet above:
    cities is an array that has three elements.
    Weâ€™re using bracket notation, [] with the index after the name of the array to access the element.
    cities[0] will access the element at index 0 in the array cities. You can think of cities[0] as accessing the space in memory that holds the string 'New York'.
You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation and the index. For instance, you can write:
const hello = 'Hello World';
console.log(hello[6]);
// Output: W
The console will display W since it is the character that is at index 6
Ex.
const famousSayings = ['Fortune favors the brave.', 'A joke is a very serious thing.', 'Where there is love there is life.'];
let listItem = famousSayings[0];
console.log(listItem);
console.log(famousSayings[3]);
//if you log something that isnt value like at the bottom it appears as undefined or falsey

Update Elements
Once you have access to an element in an array, you can update its value.
Ex.
let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
seasons[3] = 'Autumn';
console.log(seasons); 
//Output: ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn']
